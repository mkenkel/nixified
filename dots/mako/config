# Rules - match specific notifications and override settings.
# The exact matching keys (app-name / summary / body / urgency) are supported by mako.
# Below are two example rules: one for Spotify (music) and one for persistent/urgent alerts.
#
# Syntax note: rules are specified as blocks in the config. If your mako version
# requires slightly different key names, adapt accordingly (check mako docs/man).
#
# Music/Spotify rule: make album art larger, keep visible a bit longer (or persist),
# emphasize title, show artist/album on second line.
rule {
    app-name = "Spotify"
    icon-size = 64
    timeout = 0                 # 0 = persistent until dismissed (useful for currently playing)
    format = "%i  <b>%s</b>\n<i>%b</i>"
    # Optionally you can make these sticky only for "now playing" style notifications
    # by matching summary/body content (e.g. summary contains "Now playing").
}

# Another useful rule: urgent notifications (e.g., errors) should stand out
rule {
    urgency = "critical"
    background-color = "#BF616A"
    text-color = "#ECEFF4"
    border-color = "#D08770"
    timeout = 0                # make critical notifications persistent until dismissed
    format = "<b>%a — %s</b>\n%b"
}

# Optional: reduce timeouts for low-importance notifications
rule {
    urgency = "low"
    timeout = 3
}

# Tips:
# - For music, many players include artist/title in summary or body. The above format
#   shows summary (title) bold and body (artist/album) italic. If your music notifications
#   use a different field layout, tweak format accordingly.
# - Increase icon-size for music (64+) to get a good-looking album-art thumbnail.
# - If you prefer notifications for music to stay until you change tracks, set timeout=0
#   for the Spotify rule. Otherwise use a longer timeout like 10–15 seconds.
# - If you use a compositor with rounded corners or a global theme, match border-radius/colors
#   so notifications integrate visually.

# End of example config
